\title{Read TRIM data file}
\usage{
read_tdf(file, missing_code = -1L, snif = 10L, weight = FALSE,
  strict = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{\code{[character]} Input data file. See details section for spec.}

\item{missing_code}{\code{[integer]} Code for missing counts (see Details).}

\item{snif}{\code{[integer]} Number of lines read to determine input format.}

\item{weight}{\code{[logical]} Is there a weight column present?}

\item{strict}{\code{[logical]} Check data against TRIM requirements? (see Details).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns named \code{site}, \code{time},
\code{count}, and optionally \code{weight} and \code{covar01...covarNN}
for covariate labels.

\description{
Read TRIM data file
}
\section{Details}{


TRIM input data is specified in the original TRIM manual as follows.

The data file is an ASCII file containing one line (a record) for each 
combination of Site and Time. So, for \eqn{I} sites and \eqn{J} time- points, the 
number of records is \eqn{I\times J}. Each record contains the following variables
(the order is important!), separated by one or more spaces.


\tabular{lll}{
Variable               \tab Values \tab Required/optional \cr
Site identifier        \tab \code{integer < 1E8}. \tab required\cr
Time-point identifier  \tab \code{integer < 1e4}  \tab required\cr
Count                  \tab \code{integer <2e9} or missing code \tab required\cr
Weight                 \tab \code{real > 0.001}\tab optional\cr
Category of 1st covariate          \tab \code{integer} in \code{1,2,...,90}\tab optional\cr
\eqn{\vdots}           \tab\tab\cr
Category of last covariate         \tab\tab\cr
}
The missing code (see section 3.2) must be a integer in the range \code{(-32767...32767)}
and should be chosen outside the range of observed counts. Zero will usually not be
outside the range, but a negative number such as -1 will always be outside the range
of observed counts.

If \code{strict==TRUE}, the data are checked against the demands in the table.
Otherwise they are just treated as R-native types with less restrictions
on the size of integers.
